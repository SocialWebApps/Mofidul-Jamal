#Assignment 3
##Mofidul Jamal

For this assignment, I've divided the files into two parts.

Part 1 will query linkedin for data and save the data to disk.
Part 2 will load the data from part 1 and normalize the job titles. It will use the most common keywords in the job titles to assign roles to each job title and display the result.

I've implemented #2 from the assignment instructions.
