#Assignment 2
##Mofidul Jamal

I've included the IPython notebook for this assignment, which has detailed prerequisites for running my notebook because I am using a library which has a bug in the latest *released* version of the library, but the bug was fixed on their latest *development* version on their github so I have provided directions on how to overwrite the released version with the development version.

Additionally, I've provided a **video** of my program in action and an explanation of the code.
