#Midterm
##Mofidul Jamal

I've included the IPython notebook for this assignment, which has detailed prerequisites for running my notebook because I am using a library which has a bug in the latest *released* version of the library, but the bug was fixed on their latest *development* version on their github so I have provided directions on how to overwrite the released version with the development version.

Additionally, I've provided a **video** of my program in action and an explanation of the code.

I used two notebooks for this, one of them is a supplemental piece of code I used to verify my methodology for the midterm that tweets some of the bit.ly link data to my twitter account.

The second is the actual midterm assignment itself, which queries twitter for link data and plots them using a non clustered folium map.

Please note that I have removed references to my twitter api keys since you should **NEVER** upload anything to GitHub or any other public repo hosting service that contains private keys. These things are easy for bots to pick up and abuse.
