## Option 2, Education Data
For my assignment, I have opted to use option 2 which involves using 2013 college graduate enrollment information. I will parse the information provided as per the instructions, and display maps using the folium library on a per state basis.

I have discovered that a naive way of showing enrollment data per ethnicity group does not provide very much information, so I have also opted to show the enrollment data per ethnicity group localized to the state.

The set of graphs I show are:
* % of each ethnicity group in each state as a percentage of the total for that ethnicity group within the US
 * For example, if you see 5% in the state of california for ethnicity group Asian, this means that 5% of all enrolled asians in the US that enrollment data is available for exist in california.
* % of each ethnicity group in each state as a percentage of the total for that ethnicity group 
 * For example, if you see 5% in the state of california for ethnicity group Asian, this means that 5% of all enrolled students in california that data is available for is asian
 
The maps have a bit of a data bias, as the maps which are relative to the US almost always have larger #'s in the states with the highest % of the population.

The maps that are relative to each individual state are much more 
 
This notebook has depency on the following, installable via pip:

**Note that there are many maps at the end of the ipython notebook document, but I've provided 3 screenshots out of the 14 of so visualizations in the actual notebook.**
